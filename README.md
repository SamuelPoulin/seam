# Why Seam

As a competitor to other SaaS scheduling tools, Seam aims to be a complete, compromise-free solution that you can deploy on-premise or in the cloud. 

## Beautiful

Seam fits perfectly into the website you already have. You can either embed it as a widget or have it be its own seperate page. With tweakable styling and downloadable themes, it's easy to make it fit in any project and won't ever look out of place.

## Easy to setup

Seam is availaible in multiple release formats. Whether you're looking for a Docker container, binaries or just want to clone the repo and start using it, setting up is a matter of minutes thanks to straight-forward documentation and beginner-friendly config files.

## Extensible

Plugin support allows features that haven't made it to the current release to be developed independently by anyone.

## Integration

Seam supports calendar integration with most popular services so that all of your devices stay up-to-date.
